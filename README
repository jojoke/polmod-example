This is an example SELinux policy module. The build system is intended to
demonstrate:
1) how to create a policy module
2) how to build that module OUTSIDE of the refpolicy sources

We make several assumptions:
1) your system has SELinux policy headers installed
2) your system has an SELinux config file in /etc/selinux

BUILDING:
This should be as simple as running:

make prefix=/usr
make install prefix=/usr
make install-headers prefix=/usr

Notice that the build assumes that prefix is '/usr/local' so most will need
to supply make with the '/usr' prefix when running the build. The SELinux
refpol build installs with a prefix of '/usr' by default.
